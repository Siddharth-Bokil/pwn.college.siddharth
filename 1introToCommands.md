# Intro to Commands

### In this first challenge, the task was simple. I had to run a hello command and retrieve its output.

**Flag:** `pwn.college{0VfZEUYRzeLIlLsjs1Ve2zjbiSG.QX3YjM1wSN2EzNzEzW}`

## Process
I use a linux environment and I didn't find any video explanation as to how to do the challenge from my terminal. Then I realised all I had to do was run 
`ssh hacker@dojo.pwn.college`
in my own terminal **after** starting the challenge. Then I ran 
```
hello hacker
```
which led me to the flag.

## What I learned

I learnt integration of pwn.college with my terminal, and also that Linux commands are case sensitive.
