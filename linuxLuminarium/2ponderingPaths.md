# The Root

### Invoke a program using its absolute path

**Flag:** `pwn.college{QpQGRsRE67yqk2qdTSZ3US0LnHL.QX4cTO0wSN2EzNzEzW}`

## Process
Accessed the program by its absolute path, ie, ```/pwn```

## What I learned
Linux file system, absolute and relative paths, meaning of various notations, usage of different files such as usr, bin, proc, etc.
'.' - Current directory
'..' - Previous directory
'/' - Run/Invoke

## References

# Program and Absolute Paths

### Run a program by reffering to its absolute path

**Flag:** `pwn.college{8XOhp88JQhmGBNW1CKNdS-uopri.QX1QTN0wSN2EzNzEzW}`

## Process
Ran the program by reffering to its absolute path, ```/challenge/run```

## What I learned
Linux file system, absolute and relative paths, meaning of various notations, usage of different files such as usr, bin, proc, etc.
'.' - Current directory
'..' - Previous directory
'/' - Run/Invoke

# Position Thy Self

### Invoke the program using its absolute path from a particular directory

**Flag:** `pwn.college{I3gm6jqBXCP9V3z3bVEujjLAm9r.QX2QTN0wSN2EzNzEzW}`

## Process
Ran the program to get the path and then went to `/var/lib/apt/lists directory` using the `cd` command and then ran the file using its absolute path, `/challenge/run`

## What I learned
Learnt using the cd command, and meaning on ~

# Position elsewhere

### Invoke the program using its absolute path from a particular directory

**Flag:** `pwn.college{sSvpSZy9SPCmer-paHclfyUVymI.QX3QTN0wSN2EzNzEzW}`

## Process
Ran the program to get the path and then went to `/usr/share/zoneinfo/posix/Asia` using the `cd` command and then ran the file using its absolute path, `/challenge/run`

## What I learned
Same as the last challenge, nothing different.

# Position yet elsewhere

### Invoke the program using its absolute path from a particular directory

**Flag:** `pwn.college{Aipep88L8aMnFlX5E6OQAW_lz2O.QX4QTN0wSN2EzNzEzW}`

## Process
Ran the program to get the path and then went to `/sys` using the `cd` command and then ran the file using its absolute path, `/challenge/run`

## What I learned
Same as the last challenge, nothing different.

# Implicit relative paths, from /

### Ran a program by using its relative path.

**Flag:** `pwn.college{sskK1_el0Dr0m2CVVtDe9H20tyG.QX5QTN0wSN2EzNzEzW}`

## Process
Went to the `/` using the `cd` command and then ran the file using a relative path, `challenge/path`

## What I learned
Relative paths. In this specific case it wouldn't have mattered as I was already at the root directory so absolute path = relative path.

# Explicit relative paths, from /

### Ran a program by using its relative path but with '.'(cwd)

**Flag:** `pwn.college{g2_FdFgKhxhQSRdDT8fHLgWgcCs.QXwUTN0wSN2EzNzEzW}`

## Process
Went to the `/` directory using the `cd` command and then ran `./challenge/run/` to get the flag

## What I learned
Relative paths, '.' - Current working directory.

# Implicit relative path

### Running a program while being in the same directory as the program

**Flag:** `pwn.college{wCZG8TPCvDToaQ9-pRDT6dmcgEd.QXxUTN0wSN2EzNzEzW}`

## Process
Went to the `/challenge` directory using cd and then ran `./run` to get the flag.

## What I learned
Use case of `./` is so that if files that have the same name in the `/`(root) directory are not confused with other local ones. `./` acts a run command.
