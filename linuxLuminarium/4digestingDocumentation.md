# Searching For Manuals

### Search `man` to find the command to print the flag 

**Flag:** `pwn.college{gYq3p1y4cVaPyt3nrgguUN-Jrir.QX2EDO0wSN2EzNzEzW}`

## Process
This one took longer than usual. I first ran `man man` to read about any arguments that man could take which would be of help. Found `man -k` which searches the descriptions of all commands for a string and returns all matches. One of the matches was `gqpycaytnr (1)       - print the flag!`
The exclamation mark made me think this was it. First thought it was an argument to `/challenge/challenge` then found it the manpage can be opened by running `man gqpycaytnr` which led me to `/challenge/challenge --gqpyca 314` which gave me the flag.


## What I learnt
`man`'s manpage can be accessed by running `man man` and you can search the description of all commands by running `man -k searchString`

## Process
Ran `/challenge/challenge --help` and then ran `/challenge/challenge -p` to get the value as 915. Then I ran `/challenge/challenge -g 915` to obtain the flag.


## What I learnt
Some commands have guides that can be read by using the `--help` argument with them.
