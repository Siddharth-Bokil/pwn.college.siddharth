# Shinsu DEXquest

**Flag:** `citadel{f33ls_g00d_to_n0t_g3t_d33p_fr13d}`

As soon as I saw DEX, I remembered that one of tools that were provided beforehand was a DEX to Java convertor `jadx`. Opening the programming in `jadx` I found some code that asked for specific numebrs in specific places to get the `shinsu crystal`. After obtaining the crystal and entering the portal, the flag was copied to the clipboard.
