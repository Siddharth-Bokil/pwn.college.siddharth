# The Sound Of Music

**Flag:** `citadel{c0mputers_st0pped_exchang1ng_1nf0rmat10n_n_started_shar1ng_st0r1es_n_then_they_were_n0where_t0_be_f0und}`

Found a handle named `citadweller` on rateyourmusic, and the subsequent link guided me to spotify which gave the 2 parts of the flag. After sometime, I found a `citadweller` on last.fm not as an account but as a commentor which gave me the 1st part of the flag.
