# Field Day

**Flag:** `citadel{r3b3ll10n$&BU1lt:0nH0p3}`

This was a weird one. So everyone in my team tried using GPT to get the solution for this one, and 3 of us couldn't while for the last one. GPT gave him the exact flag but with the `[` and `]`. He tried submitting that as a flag but it didn't work, and then I remembered something in the UNIVAC site saying `[]` stand for uppercase and lowercase. Applying those changes made it work. We were quite shocked that GPT could solve this given that there was a lot of talk about itin the discord channel.
