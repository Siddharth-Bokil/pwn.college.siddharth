# Selected Ambient Work

**Flag:**

Initially the morse was not being detected by online morse detectors due to the backgroud music. After opening the morse in audacity, I found out that the morse was louder on the Right. Shifting the sound output closer to R and decreasing the volume made the morse code detectable. The last part of the morse was in a format similar to that of the other flags.
