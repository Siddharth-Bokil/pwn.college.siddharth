# Feels Like We Only Go Backwards

**Flag:** `citadel{f0r_0n3_m0r3_h0ur_1_c4n_r4g3}`

This one took the longest time. It was the start of the first night by the time my team and I got to this one. We tried to play the game but couldn't figure out what number kevin parker was thinking of. While I was asleep, my teammate was able to get the flag using help from GPT. He said decmopiling the code and then sending the Ghidra output to GPT gave him the flag.
