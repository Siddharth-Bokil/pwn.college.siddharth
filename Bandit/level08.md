### Print the line that occurs only once

**Password:** `4CKMh1JI91bUIZZPXDqGanal4xvAg0JM`

## Process
Ran `sort data.txt | uniq -u` to get the password.

## What I learnt
`sort fileName` orders contents alphabetically and `uniq -u` prints lines that occur only once. `uniq` prints each line once no matter how many times it may have occured.
