**Password:** `HWasnPhtq9AVKe0dmk45nxy20cvUa6EG`

## Process
Ran `cd inhere/` and `ls -al` to see a bunch of directory having a bunch of files. Ran `find . -size 1033c ! -executable` to get the flag.

## What I learnt
Find can search for a specfic file size and executability. `c` stands for characters.
