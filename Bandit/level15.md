### Use openssl to connect

**Password:** `kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx`

## Process
Ran ` openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001` and give the previous password to get the next password.

## What I learnt
`openssl s_client -connect hostName:port` connects securely(via encryption) to the host.
