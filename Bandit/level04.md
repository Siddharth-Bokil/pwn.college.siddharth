### Find the human readable file

**Password:** `4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw`

## Process
Ran `cd inhere/` and then `ls- al` to find 10 files in the directory. Catted all the files to find the `-file07` holding the flag.

## What I learnt
Files starting with `-` can be called by `./` before them.
